# Regression Analysis on Air Quality Data in Azure ML Studio

## Objective
If the air is at 100-percent relative humidity, sweat will not evaporate into the air. As a result, we feel much hotter than the actual temperature when the relative humidity is high. If the relative humidity is low, we can feel much cooler than the actual temperature because our sweat evaporates easily, cooling -us off.
`The objective of the experiment is to predict Relative Humidity(RH) in air based on other detrimental contents in air at a given point of time`
