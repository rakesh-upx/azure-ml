## Overview
Three Machine Learning projects namely Regression Analysis, Classification Analysis & Cluster Analysis  were conducted in Azure Machine Learning Studio to conveniently apply ML concepts.The projects were completed with desired outcome using powerful Azure ML algorithms & keep high hope for future scope.

## Projects below were carried out in Azure ML Studio

### 1. [Regression Analysis on Air Quality data](airquality-regression-analysis)

The analysis establishs predictive models with some powerful Azure ML algorithms to predict RH in air taking other detrimental components in air as input variables.It also offers us to find the impactful detriments in air affecting change in RH.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

The outcome of the analysis promises us to carry out further analysis on other similar datasets.




### 2. [Cluster Analysis on Crime data](crime-data-cluster-analysis)

This Analysis facilitates us assign samples to groups based on similarity using an unsupervised technique(KMeans). 

The model built on this data with the algorithm correctly chooses number of groups to be made & assigns the observations to groups with nearest corresponding group means.

The experiment carried out on Wisconsin Breast cancer data establishes a bunch of models that predict which women are at risk of Breast cancer.
  
  <br/>
  
`Support Vector Machine` was used as standalone algorithm on different sets of training & test data and each model offers promising result with.
The model performamce was measured based on many metrics such as Accuracy,Precision & Recall, F1 Score,ROC-AUC score so on & so forth.
